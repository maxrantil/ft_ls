# ft_ls
In this project, I recreated the Unix command ls, which is used to list the files in a directory. It required a deep dive into operating system API functions and data structures, as well as learning about memory management in C. The goal was to recreate the ls command with some of its options, including:

-l: List the files in long format, including file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and last modification date.

-R: Recursively list the files in all subdirectories.

-a: Include hidden files in the list.

-r: Reverse the order of the files.

-t: Sort the files by last modification time.


##challenges
One of the main challenges of this project was getting a good understanding of the operating system functions and data structures needed to manipulate the file system. I also had to be mindful of error handling and ensuring that the program could handle illegal options.


##conclusion
Overall, this was a very educational and rewarding project. I gained a deeper understanding of C programming and how it can be used to interact with the file system.
